# Song Recommendation Engine by Mood

Authors: Donna Lee 

## Data Overview 

I wanted to create a recommendation engine that took in user input for song and mood to generate song reommendations. I used a comprehensive dataset with 500K+ songs and their audio features as well as mood labels from 150 mood playlists from Spotify. 

Each song had the following attributes: 
* Acousticness
* Danceability
* Duration 
* Energy
* Instrumentalness
* Liveness
* Loudness
* Speechiness
* Tempo
* Key
* Mode
* Release Date

## EDA

For my initial model, I chose three foundational moods: happy, angry and sad. I had 150 mood playlists and in order for a song to be categorized as one of the three moods, it had to have appeared in two or more of these playlists. 

This threshold gave me a training dataset of around 2,000 songs with playlist labels.

There wasn't much of a class weight imbalance. The models used balanced class weight anyways.

The popularity of each mood category was also very similar. 



## Model Selection and Tuning

I ran two models - _KNN_ and _Random Forest_ and optimized towards a F1 Score because both precision and recall were important for this.  


| Model         | F1 Score    |
| -----------   | ----------- |
| Random Forest |   0.8126    |
|  KNN          |   0.7533    |


The **Random Forest** model had the highest F1 score so I used that when predicting the moods of the songs with missing labels.

The model was pretty good at predicting all three moods. The most common mistake was sad songs getting categorized as happy songs. 

## Predictions

These were some of the predictions! 

There was a huge class imbalance in the predictions. There were 200K+ songs predicted for each happy and song category but only 37K for the angry category. This is likely due to the overlap of song features between angry and happy songs. 

## Future steps
In some of the labeling, songs that had a slower tempo but positive lyrics were categorized as sad songs. This led to some issues with the predictions. Future steps include fine tuning the labeling and creating the recommendation engine.
